## 01-09-2023

This guide will show you how to create custom terminal commands with bash. This is very useful to have as it allows you to create shortcuts for commands you use often. Here we will look at how to run a python file using a custom command. Let's get into it!

## Step 1: Create a bash script

First, we need to create a bash script. This is a file that will contain any commands we want. We will call our script commands.sh and place it in the root directory for easy access. Either open a code editor or use touch/nano/vim. Here we will use vim.

```
    cd //go to root directory
    vim commands.sh //create commands.sh
```
