    <h2 class="mediumtitle">Step 1: Install Brew</h2>
    <p>
        If you don't have brew installed, you can install it by running the following command in terminal. If you are on another OS (Windows/Linux) you can look at this link for installation: <link>https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux</link>
    </p>
    <div class="codebox">
    <code>
        export HOMEBREW_INSTALL_FROM_API=1
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
    </code>
    </div>
    <p style="padding:0.2vw"></p>
