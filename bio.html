        I still remember the first time I saw microbots rapidly assemble to create various structures in the Disney movie, Big Hero 6. 
        I thought that what I was seeing was just an exciting fantasy of the cinematic world, but now as a student studying computer engineering, I realize that I can make such fantasies a reality. 
        My primary interest going forward is to gain experience in the engineering and computer science disciplines especially in areas like embedded systems, computer vision, and high-performance computing. In my free time I enjoy learning cardistry, playing ultimate frisbee, and exploring new technological developments.
